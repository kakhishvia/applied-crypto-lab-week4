# Applied Cryptography – Week 4 Lab (Ana Kakhishvili)

This repository contains the completed lab work for **Week 4** of the Applied Cryptography course. The tasks demonstrate practical encryption and security techniques using **RSA**, **AES**, and **TLS**.

## 🔐 Task 1: File Encryption with RSA and AES

### ✅ Files Created:
- `message.txt` – Original plaintext message
- `public.pem`, `private.pem` – RSA key pair
- `message_rsa_encrypted.bin` – Message encrypted with RSA
- `message_rsa_decrypted.txt` – RSA decrypted message
- `message_aes_encrypted.bin` – Message encrypted with AES-256
- `message_aes_decrypted.txt` – AES decrypted message
- `aes_key.bin`, `aes_iv.bin` – AES key and initialization vector
- `rsa_vs_aes.txt` – Explanation comparing RSA and AES encryption

---

## 🌐 Task 2: TLS in HTTPS

### ✅ Deliverables:
- `tls_report.txt` – Written explanation of:
  - TLS handshake
  - MITM attack protection
  - TLS in HTTPS
- `tls_mitm_explanation.txt` – Additional summary (optional)
- Screenshots from:
  - SSL Labs scan of [https://www.spacex.com](https://www.spacex.com)
  - Wireshark TLS handshake capture (Client Hello, Server Hello, Certificate)

---

## 📌 Notes:
- All tasks were completed using **Jupyter Notebook (Python)** and **Wireshark**
- This work is done independently and reflects my  personal understanding of the lab tasks
