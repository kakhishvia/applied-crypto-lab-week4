RSA is an asymmetric encryption method, meaning it uses two keys: a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. It is secure for exchanging small pieces of data like keys, but it's slower and not ideal for large files.
AES is a symmetric encryption method, meaning it uses one secret key for both encryption and decryption. It is much faster than RSA and is commonly used to encrypt large amounts of data.
In real-world applications, RSA is often used to share the AES key securely, and AES is used to encrypt the actual data.
